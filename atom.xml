      &lt;p&gt;Just-in-time compilation of SQL statements is one of the new features in PostgreSQL 11. Just-in-Time compilation (JIT) is the process of turning some form of interpreted program evaluation into a native program and doing so at runtime. While doing some testing and benchmarking with JIT it appears that PostgreSQL 11 is about 29.31% faster at executing the TPC-H Q1 query than PostgreSQL 10. You could get details from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/09/11/postgresql-11-just-in-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/09/11/postgresql-11-just-in-time/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JIT technique is implemented using LLVM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
